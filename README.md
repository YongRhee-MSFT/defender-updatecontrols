NOTE: Microsoft Defender platform version 4.18.2106.X or later is required to use these controls.

In this github repo you will find updated Windows Defender administrative templates for use with Defender update controls documented at https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/updates?view=o365-21vianet&branch=gradual-rollout. 

Typically, when using administrative templates in an Active Directory environment with a central group policy store, you would update ADMX files after a major Windows release to gain controls for new features: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/group-policy/create-and-manage-central-store. However, these files are only published as part of the major release. We recommend always using the latest available templates from that location and we will remove this repository once they get updated.
